# Practice Log
| Problem | Submission (The Code) | Key Takeaway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 430 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc430/tasks/abc430_b) | [atcoder1.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder1.ipynb) | Using set with tuple `for` duplicate checking.　List comprehension, nested `for` loops.|
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 428 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc428/tasks/abc428_b) | [atcoder2.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder2.ipynb) | Using **collections.Counter** for efficient frequency counting, and **list comprehension** for concise list creation.|
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 429 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc429/tasks/abc429_b) | [atcoder3.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder3.ipynb) | Refactored an O(N^2) solution to O(N) by pre-calculating the total sum outside the loop, avoiding repeated sum() calls within each iteration.|
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 431 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc431/tasks/abc431_b) | [atcoder4.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder4.ipynb) | Optimized performance by replacing O(N) list operations (like 'in' and 'remove') with O(1) set operations.|
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 432 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc432/tasks/abc432_b) | [atcoder5.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder5.ipynb) |Confirmed that the str type supports direct indexing for character access (e.g., s[i]).　Reviewed basic techniques, such as swapping values within a list (e.g., a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]). |
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 433 - problem_C](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc433/tasks/abc433_c) | [atcoder6.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder6.ipynb) |Identified performance bottleneck in brute-force substring search. Nested loops with sorting resulted in O(N^3) complexity, causing TLE. Need to refactor using linear scan approach.|
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 434 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc434/tasks/abc434_b) | [atcoder5.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder7.ipynb) |- |
| [AtCoder Beginner Contest 435 - problem_B](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc435/tasks/abc435_b) | [atcoder5.ipynb - my_answer](https://github.com/iamthinking98-jpg/AtCoder/blob/main/atcoder8.ipynb) |- |
